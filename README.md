# BorinquenShople

A game where you guess which Puerto Rican municipalities based on the sales of their top retail sectors!  

## Setup

Make sure you have cargo and rust installed  
Compile using `cargo build`

## How to play

1. You'll be presented with a list of 5 retail sectors and their respective sale quantities, and the total retail sales across all sectors. 
2. This is the data for a secret Puerto Rican municipality, which you'll attempt to guess.
3. Make a guess by typing the name of a Puerto Rican municipality. If you answer correctly, you win! If you answer incorrectly, the game will tell you how far away the real answer is, and the rough direction from your guess to the answer.
4. If you don't get it in 8 guesses, you lose!
